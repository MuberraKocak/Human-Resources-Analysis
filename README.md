# Human-Resources-Analysis

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:

    --Employee satisfaction level
    --Last evaluation
    --Number of projects
    --Average monthly hours
    --Time spent at the company
    --Whether they have had a work accident
    --Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
    --Department
    --Salary
    --Whether the employee has left


Files inside the Analysis folder are exactly what I did about this project.

    --Basic Exploration: Exploratory data analysis and basic understanding of dataset
    --Advanced Exploration: Exploratory data analysis and more complicated understanding of dataset
    --Models: Building models based on the analysis already made.
